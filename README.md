# Tazkia - Car Rental_React - Challenge 7

"Car Rental_React" was created for academic purpose, called Challenge Chapter 7 in Binar Academy - Fullstack Web Course. The aims of this challenge are to make react aplication (using reactJS), connect it to backend with HTTP protocols, and implement Redux to manage the data.

## About

After that, run 'npm install' and 'npm start' in your terminal. 

In the project directory, you can run:

### `npm start`

Runs the app in the development mode.\
Open [http://localhost:3000](http://localhost:3000) to view it in your browser.

The page will reload when you make changes.\
You may also see any lint errors in the console.
